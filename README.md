# vupdate

Vupdate is a basic updater tool to be included alongside your main software. It provides ability to - 
* download update files from remote servers
* offer version controlling by computing hashes of all the files and download only the needed ones
* distribute the software to anyone without the hassle of updating it constantly

## Built with

The app uses [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) library for making all the downloads and [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) for computing the hashes.

Other dependencies include [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), [indicators](https://github.com/p-ranav/indicators) and [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

## Installation

For Windows users, builds are published. For Linux and Mac users that process would take some time to setup. So, for the meanwhile, please BIY (i.e Build it Yourself).

## Development

The software is generated by CMake. You have to install [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) on your system before even starting this process. For doing so, you can take a look at your distro's package manager and find the required library to be installed. For Windows users, I would suggest you to download the binaries and set the path variable manually to the main folder. After setting up [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl), the process first involves the generation of all libraries by supplying the `COMPILE` argument as `0`. The command for which is given below - 

```sh
cmake .. -DCOMPILE=0
```

> Note: If you want to generate the project in a mode other than `Debug`, you can always use the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` flag to specify the type of build. Just remember to use it with both the dependencies and project.

After this, the project needs to be built for all the libraries to be installed.

After installing all the libraries, we can supply the `COMPILE` argument to be `1`, for generating the main programs (`vpack`, `vupdate` and `vlib`). The command for which is given below -

```sh
cmake .. -DCOMPILE=1
```

After this, you can build the project.
