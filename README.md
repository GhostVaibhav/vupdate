# vupdate

Vupdate is a basic updater tool to be included alongside your main software. It provides ability to - 
* download update files from remote servers
* offer version controlling by computing hashes of all the files and download only the needed ones
* distribute the software to anyone without the hassle of updating it constantly

## Built with

The app uses [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) library for making all the downloads and [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) for computing the hashes.

Other dependencies include [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), [indicators](https://github.com/p-ranav/indicators) and [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

## Installation

Currently, the only way to install the software is by building it yourself.

## Development

The software is generated by CMake. You have to install [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) on your system before even starting this process. For doing so, you can take a look at your distro's package manager and find the required library to be installed. For Windows users, I would suggest you to download the binaries and set the path variable manually to the main folder. After setting up [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl), the process first involves the generation of [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) library by supplying the `COMPILE` argument as `0`. The command for which is given below - 

```sh
cmake .. -DCOMPILE=0
```

After this, the project needs to be built for [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) to be installed.

> **Note for linux users (Also applies to Mac users)**
> Building of curl could be omitted, if you install it using libcurl library on your distro.

After installing the [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) library, we can supply the `COMPILE` argument to be `1`, for installing other dependencies through [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake). The command for which is given below -

```sh
cmake .. -DCOMPILE=1
```

After this, you can build the project and it will setup the dependencies initially. Afterwards, whenever you build, it will compile the project files (if modified) and also format them.
